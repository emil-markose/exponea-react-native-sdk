## What is the Exponea React Native SDK?

The Exponea React Native SDK allows you to integrate your React Native-based mobile application with Bloomreach Engagement and track your customers' behavior in your app. Integrating the SDK in your app will enable you to track events and customer properties, send push notifications, and display in-app messages and content blocks.

The React Native SDK is implemented in Typescript as a wrapper around the native [Android](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk) and [iOS](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/ios-sdk) SDKs.

The SDK is [available as open source on GitHub](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk) for maximum transparency and includes an [example app](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/react-native-sdk-example-app) you can use as a reference implementation.
